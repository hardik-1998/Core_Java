Key Points:

1. Static variable (also known as class variable) in Java is simply like another variable,
   but it is common to all instances of the class.

2. It can be accessed and modified by any other objects of class.

3. A static variable can be directly accessed by class name within static and non-static methods of the class.

4. It can be used with public and final modifiers to make constant value.

5. We cannot declare a class with static keyword but the inner class can be declared as static.

6.Static members get memory once when the class is loaded into the memory.
