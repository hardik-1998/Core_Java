Key Points
----------------------------------------------
1. A constructor cannot be final.
2. A block cannot be final.
3. A local final variable must be initialized at the time of declaration.
4. We cannot change the value of a final variable after initialization.
5. We cannot override a final method.
6. A final class cannot be extended(inherited).
7. We can create the object for a final class but cannot extend it.
    e.g.(String class is final so we can't extend it but object can be created)
8. If the method parameters are declared as final, the value of these parameters cannot be changed.
