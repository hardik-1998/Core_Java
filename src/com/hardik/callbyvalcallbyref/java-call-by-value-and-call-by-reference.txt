1. Java passes the arguments both primitives and the copy of object reference by value.

2. Java never passes the object itself.

3. In real-time project, we pass class objects as parameters to method call in Java.

4. Call by value uses copies of data, while call by reference uses memory addresses or references to the
   actual data.
